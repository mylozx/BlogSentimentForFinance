The fort consisted of log interior buildings surrounded by a palisade of pointed logs with four blockhouses, one at each corner. Six iron cannon were emplaced to protect the fort.

This uprising also resulted in the capture of Fort Sandusky, Fort St. Joseph, Fort Miami, and Fort Ouiatanon. Only Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt escaped capture.
