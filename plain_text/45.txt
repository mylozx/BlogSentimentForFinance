For the first time, the NC Division of Marine Fisheries has been forced to close all speckled trout fishing in North Carolina waters because of cold weather. The moratorium for commercial and recreational anglers starts Friday, Jan. 14, at noon. No one will be allowed to catch, possess or sell specks after that time. "This action is being taken in response to recent cold-stun events affecting mainly spotted seatrout," Dr. Louis Daniel, the NCDMF's executive director, announced in the proclamation, which was posted Jan. 11 on the division's website. "The intent of this action is to prevent harvest of vulnerable cold-stunned fish which may recover with warming water temperatures." Daniel said the proclamation would stay in effect until the NC Marine Fisheries Commission decides it should be lifted. The Commission's next meeting occurs in four weeks at Pine Knoll Shores. The catch-and-possession closure for specks will include all North Carolina waters, even as far south as the South Carolina line - areas that traditionally don't experience long periods of extremely cold weather. Licensed fish dealers have until Jan. 20 to sell, offer for sale, transport or have in possession unfrozen spotted seatrout taken in the fishery prior to the closure. The NC Wildlife Resources, which controls fishing in inland waters, has yet to announce a prohibition for recreational fishing for specks in the waters it manages. Commercial netting of spotted seatrout is prohibited at inland waters. More details on the closure are available at http://www.northcarolinasportsman.com/details.php?id=1686.
