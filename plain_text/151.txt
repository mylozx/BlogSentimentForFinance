Foul Balls: Corey Crawford's Staking His Claim Pages Home About Contact Fornelli Elsewhere Twitter Thursday, January 13, 2011 Corey Crawford's Staking His Claim There isn't a lot that this years Blackhawks have in common with the version of the team that hoisted the Stanley Cup last season. ÊInstead of cruising through the regular season the Hawks are scratching and clawing just to hold on to a possible playoff spot this year. Though, while some things change, others appear to be staying pretty much the same. Here we are halfway through another Blackhawks season, and once again, the young backup goaltender appears ready to supplant the veteran number one. Last year it was Antti Niemi taking the starting job away from Cristobal Huet, and this year it seems that Corey Crawford is about to do the same thing to Marty Turco. ÊThe difference is that Joel Quenneville seems to have figured it out a lot quicker. While Coach Q continued to play both Niemi and Cristobal throughout the regular season last year before riding Niemi through the final month, Crawford seems to have already won his coach over. ÊWhile Turco has started 23 games to Crawford's 22, Turco's last start came in 2010. ÊSo far 2011 has been the year of Crawford. It's hard to blame Quenneville for the choice, either. ÊAfter all, in his 22 starts Crawford is 15-8-1 with a 2.14 GAA and a .920 save percentage. ÊTurco is 9-10-2 with a 3.02 GAA and .899 save percentage. Following his shutout of the Colorado Avalanche last night, Crawford's now posted to back-to-back shutouts, and only seems to get better every night he's out on the ice. ÊThe truth is that even if Turco has a lot more experience than Crawford -- Turco is 35, Crawford is 26 -- Crawford seems to be a lot better suited to play behind this Blackhawks defense. Turco is the kind of guy who is serviceable behind a strong defense, but he's not going to be spectacular. ÊCrawford has that ability, and he has plenty of room to grow still. ÊWhen the Blackhawks make a mistake in front of him -- and boy do they make plenty -- he can cover his defense's ass. ÊTurco just doesn't seem capable of doing it consistently. Maybe this team knew what it was doing after all, when it decided to let Niemi take the big money with the San Jose Sharks. ÊNiemi, by the way, is 9-13-2 with a 2.85 GAA and .907 save percentage in San Jose this season. Even if he was still here, Crawford would be the best goalie on this team.
