The agreement delivers a powerful ad network for agents and advertisers to expand their reach and visibility to AOL.com's millions of monthly visitors. The AOL Real Estate experience powered by Move will deliver a user experience customized for AOL with instant access to accurate property listings, neighborhood and school content, and connections to real estate experts. Leveraging Move's ListHub network, Move will syndicate millions of listings to AOL Real Estate and power the home buyer's search experience using their proprietary search technology launched in late 2010. While Move will begin powering the AOL Real Estate homes for sale listings search experience later this year, Move and AOL Real Estate will soon begin coordinating sales efforts to benefit agents, brokers, and advertisers. Agents and brokers syndicating to AOL Real Estate through Move can receive greater efficiency by extending their reach in the online marketplace with one easy-to-manage data feed. "Our new relationship with AOL Real Estate is an exciting opportunity for Move to once again deliver on our commitment to connect agents with large, high-quality audiences of potential buyers," said Move, Inc., Chief Executive Officer Steve Berkowitz. "By remaining focused on delivering an exceptional user experience, accurate data, and high value products, Move continues to build our category leadership to the benefit of consumers, agents and brokers.

"AOL will be doubling down on our strategy in 2011," said Tim Armstrong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL Inc. "As part of that effort, we will be partnering with companies in areas that add strength to the consumer experience and drive profitability for AOL."
