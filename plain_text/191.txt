Mokopedia in artificial languages would be all in one, and much more. Adepts of different conlangs adore mocking one another. And if a conlanger learn, that such a thing in all conlangs exists, shure he will make his conlang presented there. Such a thing is not possible in the serious Wikipedia, becouse the project self, Mokopedia, is not serious at all. --Rosto 06:55, 28 February 2010 (UTC) Unworkable Sorry, so far as I understand is this a name for a group of languages. Factually, there has to be 1 ISO-code and 1 language which would suppose to support the MediaWiki. A wiki, a language | CartoonistHenning 10:49, 28 February 2010 (UTC) About 1 ISO-code see "ISO, SIL, and BCP language codes for constructed languages" in Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO,_SIL,_and_BCP_language_codes_for_constructed_languages . There is: "ISO 639-2 also has the code art for other artificial languages." Unworkable? See my blog in "Ipernity", http://www.ipernity.com/blog/79634 , it is in 4 artificial languages: Ido, Occidental, Idiom Neutral and my own Medial, see comments, they are often in different conlangs. See there blogs of Angelic Cante, Jose, Bebson Hochfeld, Valdi (Elbik), (in my network there). 6 languages in total is used there (+Esperanto and English). See Posta Mundi http://es.groups.yahoo.com/group/posta_Mundi , Bablo http://groups.google.com/group/bablo . --Rosto 12:50, 28 February 2010 (UTC) Right, but then you have to choose one of these artificial languages (vo, io, ia, nov...).

Rhubella Marie, the rat sockpreppie 640 preppiedits 21:26, 28 February 2010 (UTC) @Rhubella, you do have some reason. Mixing so many languages in one 'pedia will be troublesome. Like, which will be the main language? A solution would be to make 'pedias in many languages, like one for Ido, another one for Volapük, other one for Occidental, and so on. So, which one will go first? I'd vote for Ido (it's quite used in the auxlang forums I use to visit). -ArkBlitz 22:31, 28 February 2010 (UTC) I see that we are entering an agreement.
