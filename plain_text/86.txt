Chuck Pavlos faced criticism after a consultant's report found the city was missing fuel, as well as ongoing utility issues, according to Councilman Bill Deile. The city announced Pavlos' resignation late Thursday afternoon. Deile said city manager Gary King asked Pavlos on Wednesday to either step down or he would be fired. He said the city manager has been very vocal about changing the Cape, and while some are on board with his ideas, Pavlos was not. Pavlos has been the director of the department since 1997 and worked for the city since 1984. By Travell Eiland - bio | email You must be logged in to rate this story.
