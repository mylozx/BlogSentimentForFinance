(NYSE: AOL) will make Everyday Health the exclusive health destination for AOL Network, replacing AOL Health. Beginning April 1, 2011, AOL's nearly 14 million daily users* [*December 2010 comScore Media Metrix] seeking health content will be directed to Everyday Health's award-winning health content. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20101112/NY00568LOGO ) This partnership solidifies Everyday Health's leadership in online health. In Q4 2010, Everyday Health led the health category, according to comScore, with 26.8 million monthly unique visitors. This deal will provide AOL users with easy access to the advice, tools, guidance, and support, which has made Everyday Health so popular with health-information seekers. The deal underscores Everyday Health's importance to health marketers--the company will retain responsibility for all advertising sales, regardless of where users come from, and offer a significant increase in qualified users and valuable advertising inventory on Everyday Health.

As the exclusive health destination for AOL's health condition, disease and drug content, Everyday Health will be promoted through AOL's homepage with prominent placement throughout AOL. AOL's active health seekers will be led to EverydayHealth.com and its comprehensive portfolio of health and wellness sites that span the health spectrum - from in-depth medical content for condition prevention and management to healthy lifestyle offerings.
