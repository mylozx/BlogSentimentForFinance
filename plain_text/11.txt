The lure should be any that «  flagstaffkids.org flagstaffkids.org Just another WordPress weblog Home The lure should be any that The lure should be any that has a good action with a slow retrieval speed. The lure must also represent a source of food popular with the flathead in a given area. Mostly that would mean a lure similar to a pilchard, or anchovy, with a long slender body. Silver is more than likely the best colour but other colours, even though not fish-like in appearance to the human eye, have been known to work, such as yellow. Flathead must be handled with care. They have 2 sharp and poisonous spines at each side of the head and although the venom is not fatal, it is enough to cause a very nasty and infected wound. A quick flap of the flathead’s head and those spines can be driven into the soft flesh of an angler’s hand before they realize it. A good method is to grasp the fish firmly with an old rag or gloved hand and turn the fish over. The thumb and forefinger of the other hand can then be thrust into the gill flaps. gel coat repair This entry was posted on Thursday, January 13th, 2011 at 5:53 pm and is filed under Uncategorized.
