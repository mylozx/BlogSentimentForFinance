Jan. 13, 2011 04:59 PM BURBANK, CA -- (Marketwire) -- 01/13/11 -- Lockheed Federal Credit Union, San Fernando Valley's largest financial institution with nearly 100,000 members, hosted a tribute celebration for its long-time member Inez Harries, who along with her identical twin sister Venice Shaw, will turn 100 on January 15. The twins were honored at 2 p.m. January 12 at Lockheed Federal Credit Union's Burbank branch at 2340 Hollywood Way. According to information from the Guinness Book of World Records, Harries and Shaw are the second oldest female identical twins in the world, and the oldest in the United States. "I don't feel a century old," said Harries, who is LFCU's oldest member. "I probably don't feel any older than in my 80s." The credit union's 100-themed birthday party included one of the largest cakes local Porto's Bakery has ever baked in the shape of 100. Andrea Carpenter, Senior Vice President of Marketing, presented Harries with a gift of a $100 deposit each month into her account for the entire year. "It was an honor for our Lockheed Federal Credit Union family to celebrate Inez and Venice's birthday," Carpenter said. "The chance of twins celebrating their 100th birthday is one in 700 million; it's an extraordinary milestone and we are happy to have shared in the event." The twins share a milestone birthday with the City of Burbank, which is also hosting its centennial celebration this year. Burbank City Councilmember Gary Bric presented both women with a certificate. The Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and the Greater East Valley representative Jeudy Mom delivered birthday cards made by the children. According to a family member, the two were born in Pasadena. Harries was a Burbank resident from 1940-41; Shaw was a Glendale resident for 60 years. Burbank artist Randall Williams completed a photo restoration of a picture of the women when they were children. These restorations were presented to Harries and Shaw at the birthday celebration. "Boy, I love this (photo restoration)," Harries said. The twins will celebrate their birthday again Sunday in San Fernando with 150 family members and friends.
