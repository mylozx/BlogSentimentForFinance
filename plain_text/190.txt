Located in present day Mackinaw City, Emmet County, Michigan. The fort was peacefully taken over by the British in 1761 near the end of the French & Indian War.

The British garrison returned in 1674 and stayed until 1780 when the fort and garrison were moved out to a new Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island. Fort Michilimackinac was abandoned in 1780. Early History French & Indian War (1754-1763) Fort Michilimackinac remained in French hands until it was peacefully taken over by British Captain Henry Balfour in May 1761 as the French & Indian War was winding down. A small British garrison (35 men) remained at the fort until 1763 when an uprising of Hostile Indians captured the fort and massacred most of the garrison. This uprising also resulted in the capture of Fort Sandusky, Fort St. Joseph, Fort Miami, and Fort Ouiatanon. Only Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt escaped capture. The British re-garrisoned the ruined post on 22 Sep 1764. Revolutionary War (1775-1783) The British remained in control of Fort Michilimackinac through most of the Revolutionary War but by 1780 the fort commander, Major Patrick Sinclair, decided the risk of capture by Colonel George Rogers Clark was too great to remain. Major Sinclair obtained permission and moved the fort and all allied persons out to Mackinac Island and established Fort Mackinac. Fort Michilimackinac was abandoned in 1780.
