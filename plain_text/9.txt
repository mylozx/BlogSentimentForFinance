Game Time: 6:00 CST TV: ESPN Ê Pos #25 - Minnesota Pnt/Gm Ê Pnt/Gm #8 - Purdue Pos PG Al Nolen 8.4 Ê 5.6 Lewis Jackson G G Blake Hoffarber 13.4 Ê 18.8 E`Twaun Moore G F Rodney Williams 6.7 Ê 7.4 Ryne Smith F F Colton Iverson 6.3 Ê 5.2 D.J.

Nolen vs. Jackson - good match-up of defensive minded point guards.Ê Both are playing well as of late but I don't look at this match-up and automatically put it in Purdue's favor. Hoffarber vs. Moore - OK, this one I'll give to Purdue, Moore is very good.Ê In the three games last year Hoffarber scored 11 points...total...in three games.Ê Williams vs. Smith - not a slam dunk but the way Williams is playing lately I might even give the nod to Rodney.Ê Iverson/Mbakwe vs. Byrd - This is where the Gophers can make up some ground.Ê In the three games last year whoever was playing PF minutes really fared well against the Boilermakers.Ê Paul Carter had 15 off the bench in game 1, Damian Johnson scored a dozen in game 2 and game 3 doesn't really count cause the 27 point win was weird.Ê But Mbakwe could have a monster night tonight. Sampson vs. Johnson - should be a lock for Purdue right?Ê Except for that Ralph seems to show some fire and spark when facing Johnson.Ê RSIII didn't play in game 1 last year but game 2 was probably his most impressive in a Gopher uniform and game 3 was a 13 point performance.Ê Yes, Johnson is a potential All-American but look for Ralph to play some inspired ball tonight (PLEASE?). Purdue is the more talented team but so many times it is all about match-ups and compared to the other top teams in the Big Ten we match-up best with Purdue (Ohio State might be our worst).

Can we win it?Ê Yes we can.Ê Should be fun to watch both teams try and control this game.Ê I'd love to see Tweet 0 comments Ê|Ê Add comment Ê|Ê 0 recs Ê|Ê Do you like this story?
