Top Three Links You Must Click On From the Wires Targeted Gold Nanoparticles and Noninvasive Radio Fields Attacking One of the Deadliest and Least Curable Types of Cancer: Pancreatic Carcinoma Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation Funds research at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center on Noninvasive Radiofrequency Fields Destroying Pancreatic Andenocarcinoma Xenografts By: PR Newswire Jan. 13, 2011 05:34 PM ERIE, Pa., Jan. 13, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation ("KCRF") announces research conducted in the Kanzius/Curley Lab at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center has been published in the December 2010 issue of the American Association of Cancer Research's Clinical Cancer Research journal. The manuscript illustrates how Drs. Steven A. Curley and Evan S. Glazer's studies prove that radiofrequency fields can treat pancreatic tumors, which today, kill more than 95% of diagnosed patients. Studies found that noninvasive radiofrequency (RF) fields were effective in controlling relatively large malignant pancreatic tumors. Additionally, this process took place without any injury to surrounding tissue or changes in non-human subject behavior. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20110113/NE30158 ) The manuscript describes the process as non-human subjects are exposed to 10 minutes of nonionizing radiofrequency (RF) radiation followed by 36 hours of treatment using targeted gold nanoparticles (AuNP). This revolutionary design shows that the Kanzius RF machine alongside these particular nanoparticles create an effective formula for controlling pancreatic cancer cells. "John Kanzius, who created the RF device, once envisioned a cancer treatment that would be both effective and have zero side effects," remarked Curley, Chief of Gastrointestinal Tumor Surgery and Program Director of Multidisciplinary Gastrointestinal Cancer Care at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. "These experiments demonstrate that the Kanzius RF device controls pancreatic cancer cells without any damage to nearby cells, or normal tissues and organs. We still have a lot of work to do but this is an important proof of principle." "Every day, our team at the Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation works to help fund this incredible research," said Mark Neidig, Executive Director of KCRF. "These recent findings bring us one step closer to producing an effective, noninvasive cancer treatment that doesn't have the side effects associated with current treatments like chemotherapy and radiation."

About the Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation The Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to create national and global awareness of the potentials of the Kanzius Noninvasive Radiowave Cancer Treatment, and to help accelerate the speed at which this research progresses to human trials. The goal of KCRF is to raise money to support ongoing research grants. Pancreatic, liver and colorectal cancers in test subjects are undergoing extensive research in Houston and Pittsburgh; additional, ongoing studies are currently focused on breast, leukemic, lung, melanomic and prostate cancers. John Kanzius' sophisticated radio transmission machine is being manufactured in Erie, Pa. For more information about the Kanzius research, visit www.Kanzius.org.
