Top Three Links You Must Click On From the Wires The Venetian and The Palazzo Las Vegas Celebrate Chinese New Year 2011 Festive Decor and Traditional Dragon Dance Honors Year of the Rabbit By: Marketwire . Jan. 13, 2011 05:13 PM LAS VEGAS, NV -- (Marketwire) -- 01/13/11 -- The Venetian and The Palazzo will ring in the Chinese New Year and the Year of the Rabbit with an authentic dragon dance with firecrackers and festive decorations featuring a 16-foot, 1,000-pound animated rabbit in the atrium gardens of The Shoppes at The Palazzo with handcrafted silk hanging lanterns and orange trees representing good luck and fortune. Dragon Dance Symbolizing good luck and prosperity for the upcoming year, the dragon dance is an important ritual of Chinese culture. The Chinese consider dragons to be friendly and helpful creatures associated with strength, good fortune, wisdom and longevity. On Thursday, Feb. 3 at 3 p.m., a ceremonial dragon dance complete with firecrackers and eye painting ceremony will begin at The Venetian porte cochere, making its way through The Venetian Casino past The Palazzo Waterfall Atrium and through The Palazzo Casino, ending in the upper Palazzo porte cochere. The colorful spectacle will feature a parade of dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate costumes playing authentic music. Chinese New Year Décor Decorations in the customary color scheme of red and gold will transform both properties into a festive and bright celebration of the New Year. Both The Venetian and The Palazzo entrances will be adorned with fresh bamboo, traditional Chinese lanterns and I-Ching coins representing an abundance of wealth. The Palazzo front desk will have a 15-foot floral arrangement of oranges, bromeliads, bamboo and orchids. The Palazzo Lalique fountain garden will feature a formal garden of orchids, chrysanthemums, fresh bamboo, 15-foot bamboo trees and citrus trees. A 16-foot, 1,000-pound animated rabbit, the zodiac animal for 2011, will be situated in the atrium ground fountain. The rabbit took a team of 35 artists more than four months to conceptualize and build the one-of-a-kind piece. Six-foot-tall, hand-loomed brocade silk and jade gold and red lanterns suspended from the ceiling will signify the lives of those around to always be bright. Red lacquer bridges, bromeliads, orchids, kalanchoes, chrysanthemums, 15-foot bamboo trees and fresh-cut bamboo, citrus trees and I-Ching coins will accent the atrium gardens. Red lacquer bamboo columns with yellow cymbidium orchids, oranges, bromeliads, lucky knots and I-Ching coins will be located on the waterfall wall. Chinese New Year decorations will stay up through February. Restaurant Specials From Feb. 2-8, TAO Asian Bistro at The Venetian will offer a special meal of bo bo go sing, a rice cake stir fry with shrimp, cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, ginger, scallion, sambal chile and soy. Meaning "each step go higher," this dish represents bringing personal and professional success into the household for the new year. TAO Asian Bistro will also offer a dessert special featuring fried sesame balls made of sweet potato powder, water, sugar, sesame seeds with a sweet adzuki bean filling. Four pieces are served in a bamboo basket, representing good fortune for the New Year and wishing that money will "roll into your house." Double Helix Wine & Whiskey Bar at The Palazzo will offer half off all sake and sake cocktails on Feb. 3. ZINE at The Palazzo will also offer a special menu to commemorate the Chinese New Year.
