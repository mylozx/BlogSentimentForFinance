Suffice to say - we had a great, diverse crew on the island, scored some of the best - and longest waves - I have ever ridden and already have the island booked for next year. This is the DL from Morro Negrito - 2006. 'Round The Hood So, we live at 8,040 feet. We commute via bike some 17 - odd miles and 3,200 feet of vertical down to Boulder, most days. On the other days, we are running, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, drinking beer in the meadows and ridges around the house. The natural environment is something we are immersed in every day. This album is an attempt at reflecting on and capturing some of the beauty that we are immersed in every day. After a decade and a half of this - I am just getting warmed up and feel like a tourist seeing it for the first time every day. All these photos are in the hood - in the yard. It's a hellofa yard. Colorado Trail 2004 In August of 2004 an assortment of riders from Nederland, Belgium and Northern California set out to ride some 320 miles of trails across the amazing state of Colorado. This is their story. MorningWood Moments Snow Being that we live at 8,040 feet, weather, and snow are both a huge part of life. We shovel it, ride through it, ride on it, pray for it, curse it. We love it. Whether it's burying the ramp, blowing into hug lip launches at Edlora or carrying us over a cornice in some distant part of the state - it is a huge part of our constitution. Ç Fortunate Lives - These Ones We Live | Main January 13, 2011 F'n Locals Yes, first ride of the year, or commute of the year is more accurate. The road has been wicked sketchy, and the ice and lack of shoulder has made the riding experience safer in Boulder. But today, I needed the self propelled riding experience. It's funny, cuz something that would usually be associated with unpleasant - or scary - like riding down magnolia at 30 degrees. That, as is in many cases, ordinary, as it were, the way I unwind. Or De-wind. Knowing that the day will be crazy, and busy and whack, if I pre-load with a ride, it's much like Ben Stiller's character in Something about Mary, unloading before a date. Setting the stage as it were. So, the stinky, smelly, ornery locals of The Z almost ran me over this morning. About 50 elk, just slamming through the woods, across the road, and back into the woods. These beasts strike me much the same as many of the HUMAN locals behave. Spend almost all your time in the woods. When you see anybody - run away. Use lesser established paths, or just freestyle it through the woods. Only cross roads, in order to get to more trail or woods. Stink madly, rarely bathe, and don't talk. Hah. The last pic up there ranks with one of the more bizarre things I have seen on Magnolia. Yes, kids, it's a ladder. Right there in the road. My only thought is that it flew off someone's truck/car and landed upright, in the road. Or, perhaps someone was picking apples on an imaginary apple tree? Damn. Just when you thought you had seen it all. January 13, 2011 | Permalink Comments Verify your Comment Previewing your Comment Posted by: Ê|Ê This is only a preview.
