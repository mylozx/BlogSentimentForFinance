K. Bye.Putera Luqman Tunku Andre 07:01, 25 July 2008 (UTC) Hello tuan Andre, Bodohpedia is a wikia-wiki. Requests for admin/buro status have to be put to one of the wikia-staffers: Try Catherine, Sannse or Angela at wikia.com. Cheers and succes! D. G. Neree 10:37, 25 July 2008 (UTC) No, I want to be sysop and bureaucrat at bodohpedia not at bodohpedia wikiaPutera Luqman Tunku Andre 03:42, 26 July 2008 (UTC) Yes, sorry, i didn't look right. Carl is the one who can give you the rights. I haven't seen him for a few days, but he's sure to be around shortly. Thanks for creating an embassy-page. The project is still in a starting fase, we've just started to send the invitations. D. G. Neree 11:46, 26 July 2008 (UTC) [edit] Ikkjepedia and Scotypedia I want burocrat/sysop-rights for these wiki's, I'm native speaker Norwegian (bokmål and nynorsk) and would like to protect the Scottish one against vandalism and spam | CartoonistHenning 18:36, 5 October 2009 (UTC) [edit] Request sysop in ghItlh'a'pedia As I inform this link there are 2 active users in this wiki post sysop and ask for me and the Renan that have become interested in editing. Personally, I do not know. All I know is that the Wiki was recorded in April and has edited constantly. I think we found the site abandoned and so I'm asking the office to assist in the project.
