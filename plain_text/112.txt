Jan. 13, 2011 05:13 PM WEST PALM BEACH, FL -- (Marketwire) -- 01/13/11 -- A successful branding strategy integrates the company message into every point of contact with the public. A brand is the sum of every experience and perception customers and potential customers have had with the company and its products and services. The more recognition and positive experiences with the brand, the more likely the customer will choose it over competitors. A great way for companies both large and small to gain exposure and create loyalty is to put practical products with the company logo or name into the customer's hands. EmbroidMe offers 800,000 different possibilities for a company to get its name out there in front of prospects. EmbroidMe, the world's leading embroidery franchise, can help companies gain exposure and enhance their corporate identity through personalized promotional products and apparel. Promotional products can be offered to customers as gifts or loyalty rewards, be given as gestures of goodwill, serve as walking billboards or be used to communicate a company slogan or message. They can be offered at trade shows, sent as holiday gifts or left behind at sales calls. The variety of products available are limited only by the imagination -- from apparel to mugs, mouse pads to clocks, drinkware, environmentally friendly products, key chains and golf accessories and so much more. EmbroidMe's team of experts throughout the hundreds of locations is always on hand to help companies decide which types of products will be most beneficial for them. "Building a brand image is more than just putting the company logo on t-shirts and polo shirts," says Christine Marion, MAS at EmbroidMe. Yes, these are a part of a brand's image, "but the real impact of the brand comes from an expertly crafted and executed plan combining a multitude of products relevant to your business." About EmbroidMe: With hundreds of retail locations worldwide, EmbroidMe provides full-service custom embroidery and screen printing for apparel, as well as promotional products and gifts to both the private and commercial segments of the business community.
