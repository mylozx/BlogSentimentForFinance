Top Three Links You Must Click On From the Wires 'Truth in Numbers? Everything, According to Wikipedia' Premieres Internationally as Part of Wikipedia's 10th Anniversary Celebration Documentary, an inside look at the encyclopedic website and its cultural impact, is premiering at Wikipedia 10 celebrations in Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK By: PR Newswire Jan. 13, 2011 05:03 PM NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- "Truth in Numbers? Everything, According to Wikipedia," a film by Scott Glosserman and Nic Hill showing the inner workings of the online information resource, will make its debut in a number of countries as part of worldwide celebrations of Wikipedia's 10th anniversary on January 15, 2011. Anniversary celebrations in Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK will include screenings of the film for wikipedians and other fans of the website. The film illustrates a debate between traditional media and the proponents of crowd-sourced information over the reliability of the information found on Wikipedia, and the impact of having such a widely-used resource written and edited by non-experts. Using interviews with Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, Noam Chomsky, the late Howard Zinn, Jaron Lanier, Lawrence Lessig, Ray Kurzweil, and many others, "Truth in Numbers?" reveals surprisingly intense and emotional opinions on both sides, while also giving viewers an inside look at how Wikipedia works, who exactly is editing on the site, and the enormous international cultural phenomenon that it has become in the 10 years since its founding. Glosserman and Hill presented the film for the first time ever in July, 2010, in Gdansk, Poland at Wikimania, the annual gathering of the Wikimedia community. Subsequently, "Truth in Numbers?" made its North American debut in October at the Paley Center for Media in New York City. In keeping with the spirit of Wikimedia and the Creative Commons license under which the film was created, Glosserman and Hill are making the film available for free to anyone hosting a Wikipedia 10 celebration. In addition, many Wikimedia organizations worldwide are selling DVD's as part of a non-profit fundraising program. More information about the film, the filmmakers and the participants can be found on the "Truth in Numbers?" website at www.truthinnumbersthemovie.com and the Facebook page www.facebook.com/truthinnumbers.
