Top Three Links You Must Click On From the Wires fluidOps and HIGHFLEET Enter Strategic Partnership By: Business Wire Jan. 13, 2011 04:59 PM fluid Operations (fluidOps™), a leader in cloud computing and semantic technologies, and HIGHFLEET, a software product and solutions firm for semantic data integration and ontology-based deductive databases, today announced the beginning of a long term cooperation in the field of information management. Dr. Andreas Eberhart, Managing Director at fluid Operations emphasizes the value of this partnership: By combining HIGHFLEET’s ontology-based deductive databases with fluidOps’ open platform for intelligent information management, Information Workbench™, customers receive systems that not only efficiently answer high-value queries but enable extensive visual exploration. fluidOps’ Information Workbench provides a flexible and extensible widget-based user interface for integrating and connecting data from different sources and uses novel interaction paradigms to search, visualize and explore interrelationships of data. Users will especially benefit from the capabilities for visual exploration of associated data delivered through Information Workbench, states, Michael Davis, President and CEO of HIGHFLEET. Together with HIGHFLEET’s mature software with unparalleled performance in its deductive databases and semantic federation solution, users are now able to get the answers they really want and avoid expensive, brittle, heavy weight applications that struggle to get value from traditional information systems, states Dr. Eberhart, fluid Operations.
